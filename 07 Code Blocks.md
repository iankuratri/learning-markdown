Here is my code:

```js
const name = "Ankur";
console.log(`Hi, ${name}`);
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Hey, Did you try `thanos-js` ?

```diff
var x = 100;
- var y = 200;
+ var y = 300;
```
